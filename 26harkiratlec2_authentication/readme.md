hashing 
- hashing is one way
- given the output, no one can find out the input
- changing the input a lit bit changes the output by a lot.

Encryption
- encryption is a two way
- a string is encrypted using a password
- string can be decrypted using the same password.

Json Web Token 
- it's neither of encryption or hashing (digital signature)
- anyone can see the original output given the signature
- signature can be verified only using the password.
