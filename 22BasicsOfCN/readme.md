Protocols
- protocols are a set of rules and regulation setup  to communicate and share information over a network.
- HTTP, UDP, TCP, SMTP, etc.

Packets 
- in order to share data, we can't send big chunk of data over the network.
- so, we divide data in smaller chunks.these smamller chunks are called as packets.

Address
- sending messages over the network requires the destination details

Ports
- Any machine could be running many network applications apps.
In order to distinguish these apps for receiving messages. we use ports.
(port number)
- address -> belonging to the machine and to reach that machine we need to know the port.
- ports helps you to get the packets to the specific process on the host.
- every process has 16 bit port number
- 0 to 2^16 (65535) (range of port number)

- 0 to 1023 - is known as well known ports.
- PORT 80 - belongs to http
- port 443 - https (these are reserved for speicific applications)

- 1024 to 49152 -> resgistered ports (3000 node js ports )
- they are used by specific, potentially propreities apps/process that are known but not system defined.
- SQL server uses 1433 ports
- mongoDB compass -> run on 27017 port number (registered port).
- end user application will use these range.
- we can also change these range.
- 49152 to 65535 -> these are called as dynamic ports.
